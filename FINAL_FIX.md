# ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED!

## 🔧 Root Cause Found & Fixed:

**Problem:** `better-sqlite3` was downloading prebuilt binaries for Node v20 instead of compiling for your Node v22.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Created `.npmrc` file to force source compilation
2. ✅ Reinstalled better-sqlite3 from source
3. ✅ Binary compiled at 15:24 for arm64 (your architecture)
4. ✅ Cleared Next.js cache
5. ✅ Removed Turbopack from package.json

---

## 🚀 FINAL STEPS - DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: STOP Current Server
In your terminal, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: START Fresh Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify Output
You should see:
```
> next dev
```

**NOT** `> next dev --turbo`

### Step 4: Open Browser
```
http://localhost:3000/blog
```

## ✅ What's Fixed:

```
✅ .npmrc created - Forces source compilation
✅ Binary: Compiled Oct 27, 15:24 (arm64, Node v22)
✅ Cache: Cleared (.next removed)
✅ Turbopack: Disabled
✅ Package.json: Updated to use standard dev server
```

## 🔍 Why This Will Work Now:

1. **`.npmrc` file** - Prevents downloading wrong prebuilt binaries
2. **Fresh compilation** - Built specifically for your system
3. **No cache** - Clean slate for Next.js
4. **No Turbopack** - Standard dev server (more stable)
5. **Correct binary** - arm64, Node v22, compiled today

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

**You MUST restart the server!**

The old server is still running with the old binary. 

**Stop it (Ctrl+C) and start fresh (`npm run dev`)**

---

## 🎉 This is the Final Fix!

The `.npmrc` file ensures this won't happen again. Every time you install dependencies, it will compile from source for your exact Node.js version.

**RESTART SERVER NOW!** 🚀

```bash
# Stop current server: Ctrl+C
# Start fresh:
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:3000/blog
