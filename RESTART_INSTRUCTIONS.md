# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Need to Restart the Server!

## 🔴 Current Problem:

Your terminal shows:
```
> next dev --turbo
```

But I changed it to:
```
> next dev
```

**The old server is still running with Turbopack!**

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop Current Server
In your terminal, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

This will stop the current server.

### Step 2: Start Fresh Server
Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify
You should see:
```
> next dev
```

**NOT** `> next dev --turbo`

## 🎯 Why This Matters:

- ✅ Turbopack was caching the old binary
- ✅ Standard Next.js dev server will use the new binary
- ✅ The binary was freshly compiled at 15:16 today
- ✅ It's ready to work!

## 🚀 DO THIS NOW:

1. **Stop server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal
2. **Start fresh**: Run `npm run dev`
3. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000/blog

**The fix is ready, you just need to restart!** 🎉
